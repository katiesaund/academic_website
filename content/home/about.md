# Hi, I'm Katie!

I'm a computational biologist currently taking a career break. I am open to discussing part-time consulting, but will not be returning to full time employment in the near term. 

For several years I worked at Denali Therapeutics, a biotech developing therapies for neurodegenerative diseases. I worked with multi-omics datasets to validate biomarkers of disease progression, target engagement, and pathway modulation. These analyses were performed on data dervied from patient tissues, cell culture models, and animal models. My favorite project characterized alternative splicing in neurodegenerative diseases.

I completed my PhD in University of Michigan's Microbiology & Immunology Department. I used computational biology approaches and bioinformatics tools to conduct my research investigating the genomics of the bacterial pathogen *C. difficile.* To support my genomic analyses I contributed to the development of [prewas](https://github.com/Snitkin-Lab-Umich/prewas), a software package that preprocesses called SNPs prior to running bacterial genome-wide association studies (GWAS). I also wrote a software package to perform bacterial GWAS called [hogwash](https://github.com/katiesaund/hogwash). 

While in graduate school I interned with the Genetics and Pharmacogenomics Department at Merck. I analyzed single-cell RNA sequencing data for early discovery oncology applications. 

Between undergrad and my PhD I worked as a wet lab scientist performing research in an immuno-oncology lab in Seattle. While I stick to the dry lab now, I am comfortable with many lab techniques and enjoy collaborating with experimental biologists and clinicians.
