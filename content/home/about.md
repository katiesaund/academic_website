# Biography

I'm a postdoctoral research scientist in the Snitkin Lab at the University of Michigan. I completed my PhD in November 2020 in UM's Microbiology & Immunology Department. I use computational biology approaches and bioinformatics tools to conduct my research. My  research investigates the genomics of the bacterial pathogen *C. difficile.* To support my genomic analyses I contributed to the development of [prewas](https://github.com/Snitkin-Lab-Umich/prewas), a software package that preprocesses called SNPs prior to running bacterial genome-wide association studies (GWAS). I also wrote a software package to perform bacterial GWAS called [hogwash](https://github.com/katiesaund/hogwash). 

I am currently seeking computational biology opportunities in biotech and pharma that are either remote or Bay Area-based.
