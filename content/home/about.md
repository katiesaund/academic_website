# Hi, I'm Katie!

I'm a postdoc in the Snitkin Lab at the University of Michigan. I completed my PhD in November 2020 in UM's Microbiology & Immunology Department. I use computational biology approaches and bioinformatics tools to conduct my research. My  research investigates the genomics of the bacterial pathogen *C. difficile.* To support my genomic analyses I contributed to the development of [prewas](https://github.com/Snitkin-Lab-Umich/prewas), a software package that preprocesses called SNPs prior to running bacterial genome-wide association studies (GWAS). I also wrote a software package to perform bacterial GWAS called [hogwash](https://github.com/katiesaund/hogwash). 

While in graduate school I interned with the Genetics and Pharmacogenomics Department at Merck. I analyzed single-cell RNA sequencing data for early discovery oncology applications. 

Between undergrad and my PhD I worked as a wet lab scientist performing research in a immuno-oncology lab in Seattle. While I stick to the dry lab now, I am comfortable with many lab techniques and enjoy collaborating with experimental biologists and clinicians.
