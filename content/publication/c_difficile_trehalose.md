abstract = "In a caseâ€“control study of patients with _Clostridium difficile_ infection, we found no statistically significant association between the presence of trehalose utilization variants in infecting _C. difficile_ strains and development of severe infection outcome. These results do not support trehalose utilization conferring enhanced virulence in the context of human _C. difficile_ infections."
